How to spread Certificate Authorities like Let's Encrypt

# Why

## Freedom of choice

When you build a website, you need to choose:

- A name.
  - For that, you my choose one related to your country (country code top-level domain, such as `.uk` or `.fr`)
  - Or a generic top-level domain (such as `.xyz`)
  
  Either way, there are a lot of registrar, and you have the possibility to choose a free one.
  
- An hosting provider.

  A lot of hosting provider are avaliable. And you can self-host for free if you prefer.

- A certificate authority.

  There are some of them. And really few provide a really free solution.

If you are, for example, in Europe, and you want to host your website in Europe, under an European tld (`.eu`, or another such as `.fr`, `.de`, `.it`...) using only European companies:

  - You have the choice for your registrar
  - You have the choice for your hosting provider
  - The choice for your certificate authority is very limited
